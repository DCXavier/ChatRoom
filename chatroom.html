                    Hi guys lov got the O2 package and have really slow internet.A speed check online said i can get 3mbps but
                    it seems more like 0.5 these days,just freezing and taking ages to open pages and open audio files for
                    example.I have decided to switch to the UPC package which offers 10mbps but do you think i will get it?

                    I have Internet for 9 month and nevere could benefit from the full capacity of 5Mbit/s as it is filtered by O2
                    when it detect traffic on public p2p sharing in my situation all my internet speed slows to 512Kbit/s.I never had
                    400KB/s on when downloading from p2p public servers like torrent emule etc.I download with 500KB/s from
                    private trackers instead.So conclusion O2 block traffic on p2p connections.I have made hundreds of test in Italy
                    and eden and Romania with same file to download with same setting adn same antivirus and just
                    needed to open ports in fire wall and forward same ports and the speed was at full capacity in 1 minute. here in
                    9 month never had this luck.

                    Funny comparison,so would the proper antivirus not slow down the internet as much or do you mean a
                    freebie doenst protect the computer from viruses?

                    I pay for the 4Mb/sec down,512Kb/sec up service from O2,and haven't had any problems.In fact,it's rela-
                    tively quick,and stable.It's not perfect,but I really don't have issues,as long as I keep track of what I'm doing
                    on it.I max out at about 3Mb/sec down, and 350Kb/sec up.Probably because of a noisy telephone line,not
                    because I'm being throttled.When my uploads go over 25KB/sec(note, bytes,not bits),my download speed
                    suffers.This is expected,as downloads require upload bandwidth as well.
